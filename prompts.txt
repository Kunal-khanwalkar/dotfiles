Once you have been living your best life for 3 - 4 months you will feel like this is who you have always been.
Every morning is a gift. Do not take your life for granted.
In adversity, you've proven to be far more resourceful than you seem.
Don't invent sorrow where there's none.
Security means safety. When you provide value to others, they provide security to you.
